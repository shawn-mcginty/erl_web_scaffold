# Erlang Web Scaffold
> quick skeleton of a web app using erlang for the backend

## Technologies
### Backend
	1. Erlang
		- Mix for builds (so I guess Elixir is involved/required)
		- Cowboy for http/websockets
	2. Postgres
		- Currently configured for PG, it could easily be switched out

### Frontend
	1. Webpack
	2. Vue.js
	3. Bulma (CSS)
	4. Font Awesome
